# This is for my segmentation practice
The code is for me to test my ability to segment vertebraes using the [TotalSegmentator](https://github.com/wasserth/TotalSegmentator) solution.

The data used is the one found on the [TotalSegmentator](https://github.com/wasserth/TotalSegmentator) github. The data can be found [here](https://zenodo.org/records/10047292) and is from the reserach paper by J. Wasserthal et al [1].

# Reason for repository
The reason for the repository is for me to test the progam using GPUs from online solutions.
